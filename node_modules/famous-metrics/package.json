This module exposes three interfaces:\n\n* getTinfoil: Returns true if the user has not opted into tracking and false if they have.\n\n* setTinfoil: Accepts an email address and a callback. The email will be hashed and included with tracking information. If you pass in false instead of an email or no email string, then tracking is disabled.\n\n* track: Accepts a string with the name of the event and any additional data to be tracked. Will print a warning to the console if the user has not opted into famous.\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2014 Famous Industries, Inc.\nMPL-2.0\n\nAuthor\n------\nAndrew de Andrade <andrew@famo.us>\n\n",
